Meet The Sharks
Local Venture Capitalists, Accelerators, Angels and Entrepreneurs come meet in a reversal of the usual roles. Instead of startups on stage, the investors pitch what they do and get grilled by a panel of startup founders! Doesn't happen quite every month, but close to it.

1 Million Cups
A weekly morning series of startups sharing their stories with each other. Rather than a showy, public pitch, 1 Million Cups is a place to lower your guard, share your story, and discuss the realities of statup life. It's a safe zone for entrepreneurs.
