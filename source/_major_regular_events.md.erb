### [Houston Demo Day](http://www.meetup.com/Houstons-Startup-Demo-Day/)
Every month, four Houston startups are given a platform to introduce themselves to the community, pitch before a panel of investors and mentors and get feedback. Hosted by START, normally the 4th Wednesday of the month. Exceptions do happen, so check the Meetup!


### [Lean Startup Circle](http://www.meetup.com/leanhouston/)
Meetup focused on Lean methodologies, with talks by founders, industry panels, "working meetups" and happy hours. Normally 2nd Thursdays of each month, but exceptions do happen, so check the Meetup!


### [Startup Grind](http://startupgrind.com/houston/)
A moderated discussion series and intimate dinner with a Houston startup CEO, often centered on a particular topic.


### [1 Million Cups](http://houston.sites.1millioncups.com/)
A weekly morning series of startups sharing their stories with each other. Rather than a showy, public pitch, 1 Million Cups is a place to lower your guard, share your story, and discuss the realities of startup life. It's a safe zone for entrepreneurs.


### [Meet The Sharks](http://www.meetup.com/meet-the-sharks/)
Local Venture Capitalists, Accelerators, Angels and Entrepreneurs come meet in a reversal of the usual roles. Instead of startups on stage, the investors pitch what they do and get grilled by a panel of startup founders! Doesn't happen quite every month, but close to it.


### [SLGT Coffee Club](http://www.meetup.com/slgtcoffee/)
Monthly morning meetup focused on building a community of entrepreneurs, investors, and techies interested in supporting our local businesses and economy. Normally 3rd Thursday of the Month. Exceptions do happen, so check the Meetup!
